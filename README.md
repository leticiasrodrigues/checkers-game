## Code structure
There are two main objects
- ``Game``

Holds the logical structure of the game. Verifies if a given move is valid or not and execute it.
The board is represented on a 8x8 structure. 0 represents a empty space, 1 and 2 the players 1 and 2 and 11 and 12 are for checkers. 

- ``Board``

Responsable for visually represent the game. It has a 8x8 matrix of ``Squares`` and can change their background colors and pieces. Each Square has a default background color (black or white) and can or not have a piece.

There is a forth objetc there is ``GameState``. It holds informations about each move: who is the actual player, the pieces he has selected and how much remaining pieces each of then have.

Finaly we have the ``main`` file, who unites those classes.
